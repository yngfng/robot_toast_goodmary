TIPS FOR PLAYING THE GAME:

Being a robot is hard, and being a robot ninja is even harder! When you're hungry for toast, keep these tips in mind an you're sure to satisfy your appetite!

*Your jump height varies based on how long you hold the button
*Pressing against a wall while you're in the air initiates a "wallslide" This increased friction and slows your fall
*While in a Wallslide, press jump to walljump.
*If you wallslide past the edge of a platform, you'll grab onto it. You can turn around while ledge grabbing. Turn the direction you want to jump before jumping for the biggest distance!
*The grapple is tricky to master, but a very flexible tool. Remember, the grapple fires in the direction you're pointing (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), but it defaults to a 45 degree angle. When in doubt, just let off the movement controls and fire!
*The grapple can also extend and retract. Experiment with using this to adjust your momentum. Retract before you jump and fling yourself to great heights!
*The Jet Boots have a limited charge, which takes a moment to refill. Once you've done a long burn remember to wait a second for them to come back to full power.
